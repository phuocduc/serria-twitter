## User Stories

Required User Stories:

* [ ] The user should be able to enter a message into a text field.
* [ ] The user should be able to press "Tweet" and see the message pop in below the text box.
* [ ] The user should see a "count" that displays how many more characters the user has remaining, counting down from 140.
* [ ] Upon tweeting, the characters remaining text should reset back to 140, and the field should be cleared.
* [ ] The application should disallow text of greater than 140 characters.
* [ ] The user should be able to "Retweet". Clicking Retweet immediately inserts a copy of that tweet below the original tweet.
* [ ] The user should be able to "Like". When "Like" is clicked, the text should change to "Unlike". When "Unlike" is clicked, the text should change to "Like". Alternatively, use a heart icon (colored or not colored).
* [ ] When a "Liked" tweet is retweeted, the new tweet should not be liked.
* [ ] Each tweet has an optional hashtag. The hashtag should be linked with an anchor tag.
* [ ] The user should be able to delete a tweet.

Optional Stories:

* [ ]  Download and upload the list of tweets using the myjson api, as shown in class.
* [ ] Users can mention other users. Any string that starts with @username will be highlighted in blue.
* [ ] The user can click on a hashtag, and only other tweets with that hashtag are shown.
* [ ] When the user deletes a tweet, all retweets should be deleted.
* [ ] Any tweet with an image URL will have the image automatically expanded in the tweet.
